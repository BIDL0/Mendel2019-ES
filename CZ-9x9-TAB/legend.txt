The samples in both subdirectories represent the same solution except that:

- 'complete' contains all modifying transition rules as they were evolved

- 'optimized' contains only the rules which are needed to develop the pattern
  (the optimization was performed by deterministically choosing the given rules
   after obtaining the results from the evoluion)
